Description: Specification and estimation of multinomial logit
    models.  Large datasets and complex models are supported, with an
    intuitive syntax.  Multinomial Logit Models, Mixed models, random
    coefficients and Hybrid Choice are all supported.  For more
    information, see Molloy et al. (2019) <doi:10.3929/ethz-b-000334289>.
